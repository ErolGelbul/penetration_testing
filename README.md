<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Penetration Testing
This report focuses on a penetration test on a Linux target machine with the intent to test the security measures’ validity and strength. The report starts out with giving information on this target machine and explaining more about the timeline of execution each task. The penetration test for this target machine has already been completed.
The tasks for the penetration test start out with multi layered scans from distinct scanners to visualise the severity of the security holes and potential security breaches that may be executed. After the scans, there are five exploits to be explained and later, mitigation of these vulnerabilities is discussed. 
Exploits were chosen from the scan results, such as DIRB scans relaying web directories that could be read. Moreover, gaining entry to the system assisted the penetration test to expedite escalating privileges. Outdated services opened a path to use the “Remote Code Execution” exploit. Due to the existence of out-of-date services, other methods were also worked on such as trying to attack using buffer overflow. Since the target machine provided an entry portal it was useful to identify if the users of this system were using secure usernames and passwords, by attacking by brute force.


Note: This penetration test was done with the intent to find vulnerabilities and the target machine was notified prior to the attack.


More information about the test may be found on my [blog post](https://erolgelbul.com/project-blog/penetration-testing).
